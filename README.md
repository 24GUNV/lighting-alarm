# Lightning Alarm Tool

This program periodically scrapes data off [WeatherBug](https://www.weatherbug.com/) to see how close lightning is to our school. 
If lightning is within 5km of school perimeter, an automatic signal will be sent out to a microcontroller to automatically activate a lightning alarm system.
